# Telecom-Customer-Retention
This project applies machine learning to predict if a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the service).
Using customer data like contract type, payment method, tenure, and monthly charges to train the model.

The data was cleaned and preprocessed, categorical columns were encoded using OrdinalEncoder, and class imbalance was handled using RandomOverSampler.
A Random Forest Classifier was trained and evaluated, achieving 88% accuracy and 95% recall for churn detection.

Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab
